This script removes 3rd party integrations and demo material from a fresh Pro Tools install, then starts the Avid Link Uninstaller.

To be able to remove files from /library and /usr/local/share, it has to run with admin privileges (sudo). If you're not sure what that means, you probably shouldn't run the script this way.

Tested with PT 2025.10 and 2025.12
